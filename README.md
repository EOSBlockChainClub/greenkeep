EOS Hackathon Entry

<b> Decentralising agricultural data via the blockchain </b>

We developed a dApp that allows all stakeholders in the farming industry to record and decentralise key information about their operations. A business client or a consumer can easily access the GreenKeep smart contract and obtain live and relevant information about the current or any previous goods that have been produced. The information can range from important metrics such as the age of meat products being produced, to the amount of free roaming that cattle are allowed to undertake in.

More environmental statistics will also be logged, such as the usage of water, fertiliser and feed. This allows individuals to make informed decisions about the products that they are buying and whether the farm they are sourced from are trying to make a positive difference.

Farms that hold high standards will adopt our technology as a way to further market and verify their ethical and sustainable practices. This will grant them an advantage over the homesteads that have not yet adopted. Purchasers will not longer have to rely on vouching and connections when looking for new places to source products from. 

This solution is lightweight and cost effective to launch as we are piggybacking off existing technologies, such as the EOS ecosystem and various smart farming sensors that have already been implemented on properties. Physical hardware to push and record data will be installed onsite.

The business model we are followed is SaaS, we allow farms to utilise the hardware that will record and push data to the blockchain. The farmers will pay a service fee over time if they wish to continue using the technology.
